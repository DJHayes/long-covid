Being an early exploratory trial, we are examining the generalizability of any therapeutic effect to the general diagnosis of the condition of Long-COVID.	The intervention involves exposure to polychromatic light (Light Therapy) emitted from a medical device specifically designed to treat the insomnia, depression and fatigue of Long-COVID. As is the case for treatment of other disorders with these symptoms (such as Seasonal Affective Disorder: SAD), patients will be treated for 30 minutes to 1 hour per day with a measure amount of light at 3,000 to 5,000 LUX. Patients will be monitored and assessed during face to face or telehealth consultations on a regularly scheduled basis. This is to ensure that the light is delivered to optimize phototransduction and to maximize the therapeutic effect. The duration of treatment will up to 3 months but may be terminated earlier (no less than 1 month) if a therapeutic effect is observed.  The treatment will be delivered by a clinician with over 30 years of experience in treating sleep and psychiatric disorders using this methodology. The patient will be thoroughly briefed and monitored to ensure the light is delivered at the right time in the circadian cycle. The device will be used at home and ongoing device use will be monitored to ensure compliance. The Chief Investigator will be in contact with other health professionals to ensure treatment is compatible with other ongoing treatments.  Treatments will be delivered daily at the critical time in the circadian cycle and patients will be monitored/assessed every week to week and a half.

The design and dose of the intervention are based on the demonstrated effectiveness of the expectation management intervention from the PSY-HEART trial, on the SOMA.GUT study within RU5211 SOMACROSS, and on other previous studies. The intervention consists of 3 individual online video consultation sessions at an interval of 2 weeks each and a booster session after 3 months, with each session lasting 45 minutes. Homework will be given after each session to deepen the acquired skills. The intervention thus addresses the topics of "dealing with anxiety", and "improving expectations" as well as patients' need for information about their disease.<br><br>                Experimental intervention 2 (COV.SUPPORT + TAU):<br>                This experimental intervention consists of a non-specific supportive intervention (COV.SUPPORT) in addition to TAU.

Participants will meet with a clinical exercise physiologist (CEP) either online or face to face depending on your location. In this meeting the clinical exercise physiologist will explain to participants how to record, interpret, and log the details into the diary. The CEP will also take participants through some physical activity that corresponds to your HRV. They will discuss how to use each participants' HRV data to select the appropriate exercise. The CEP will also help prescribe exercise sessions and also personalised exercise intensity for the rest of the week and this will be up to 150 minutes, depending on the participants ability and exercise history. In week two you will meet with the CEP; they will teach participants when and how to increase daily functional activity. The CEP will help participants manage physical activity over the next 10 weeks, by meeting with them once per week for between 45-60 minutes and helping to set appropriate goals for physical activity for the week, alongside this the CEP will be reviewing and adjusting the program on a weekly basis.

These devices are commercially available over the counter (OTC), or online without prescription, and having been specifically developed for safe use without training and with only minimal written instructions participants should find these TENS devices straightforward to use.<br><br>                The research assistant (RA; or research team member) will set up the stimulation parameters for the TENS device and train the participant to use the device at the end of their visit to the laboratory, after completing laboratory assessments. The RA will first explain to each participant that, â€˜the aim of the study is to test the effects on fatigue of stimulating different parts of the ear lobe at different levels of stimulationâ€™. The RA will then set stimulus parameters during the TENS demonstration by determining sensory threshold and pain/discomfort threshold for tragus, pinna and earlobe stimulation and instructing the participant to set the TENS at a specified current setting whenever it is used.<br><br>                To activate the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (taVNS) a clip electrode connected to the TENS system will be attached to the left tragus. Fabric sleeves, cut to the correct length to cover the two prongs of the ear clip electrode, ensure that the electrode gel (Spectra 360 Electrode Gel, Parker Laboratories Inc, NJ, USA) applied in between the ear clip electrode, or that the saline used to moisten the sleeves, makes a good electrical contact with skin of the trag

Intervention1: Sudarshan Kriya: Sudarshan Kriya is a technique taught by the Art of Living Foundation in more than 156 countries with more than 6 million practitioners across the globe. It is taught in various modules across various age groups in different parts of the world. <br>SKY is a cyclic rhythmic breathing technique with its roots in traditional yoga. The 25 minutes process includes three yogic components Ã¢?? pranayama, Om chanting and Sudarshan Kriya. The pranayama is done using the Ujjayi breath. Ujjayi involves experiencing the conscious sensation of the breath touching the throat. This slow breathing technique is performed at a rate of 2Ã¢??4 breaths per minute (bpm). This technique improves lung capacity, allowing more air to pass through the lungs.  Ã¢??OmÃ¢?? is chanted three times with prolonged exhalation. Lastly, Sudarshan Kriya rhythmic breathing is done in two variations:- long SKY, which is done under Gurudev Sri Sri RavishankarÃ¢??s recorded instruction, and short SKY which can be done can be done at home taking slow (20 bpm), medium (40Ã¢??50 bpm), and fast (60Ã¢??80 bpm) breaths.

The total amount should be around 150 minutes per week. The individual training intensity is below the endurance limit in each case, so that overloading is avoided.<br>The average training heart rate should be in the range between 60 and 80% of the maximum heart rate.<br>For the home-based implementation of the intervention, the participants receive wearables with which the activity and training data are collected. In connection with the coaching, it should be ensured that the interventions lead to a significant improvement in reduced resilience and fatigue without the participants being overwhelmed by extent or intensity. The types of training are selected individually so that the best possible adjustments to the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system are achieved. The training can include the following types, among others: cycling, ergometer training, walking, Nordic walking, jogging, running, rowing ergometer, shoulder-arm ergometer or cross trainer. Everyday activities such as cycling can also be viewed as training-relevant loads, depending on the intensity. If necessary, the training specifications are adjusted after the feedback discussions after 1, 4 and 8 weeks. Intervention 2: Waiting control group: Participants in the waiting control group receive general information and recommendations on physical activities.<br>After completion of the wait-control period, the participants receive the identical program as described for the intervention group.

The video includes  a3 x 5 min SPB exercise with a 1-min break between each 5 min SPB unit, corresponding to a total of 17 min. The 1 min break between each SPB unit was introduced based on previous experience of participants reporting 15 minutes of non-stop SPB was very demanding. Exhalation (5.5 s) lasted slightly longer than inhalation (4.5 s) as prolonged exhalation contributes to larger beat-to-beat heart fluctuations compared to a prolonged inhalation, and therefore induces a higher CVA.<br>Recording: The electrophysiological markers will be assessed using EEG, ECG, GSR and biochemical markers of stress per protocol. The acquisition and analysis for the mentioned markers have already been standardized in the laboratory. <br><br>

This is a crossover study with two weeks of intervention (3 sessions per week with six sessions in total) and a week washout period in between. Participants will receive a combination of light acupuncture and five-element music therapy from a licensed acupuncturist at the ECU Acupuncture Research Clinic. Each session will last 25-30 minutes, including preparation, treatment, and conclusion of treatment. The 3B Laser Pen (200mW) used in the intervention will have a wavelength of 808 nm in continuous wave mode to be applied to bare skin. Each pressure point will receive 20 seconds of energy (4J), with 20 minutes being the maximum treatment time (240 J). During the treatment, the participant will be listening to the five-element music (for the duration of the light therapy) depending on their emotional types (fear, anger, joy, anxiety, and sorrow). For example, if one has anger, frustration, and rage, it could indicate they have too much Yang energy or problems with Liver or detoxification pathways.

This intervention is based on the cognitive-behavioural model of fatigue, stating that disease and/or its treatment initially triggers fatigue while cognitive-behavioural variables perpetuate fatigue. <br>Patients randomised to iCBT will receive 17 weeks of individual iCBT, based on an existing treatment manual for chronic fatigue which has been adapted to COVID-19. iCBT will be delivered by trained cognitive-behavioural therapists on a secured webportal and entails up to 9 modules. Of these modules, 7 target the perpetuating factors of fatigue. Patients only receive modules that are indicated for them, based on baseline scores (T0) and intake. Patients who are not able or willing to follow iCBT will be offered face-to-face  CBT at a treatment facility or via video consults using the same treatment manual. <br><br>Care as usual<br>Currently, care as usual for patients who passed the acute phase of COVID-19 can entail different forms of care. Participants will have no access to the study intervention during the study period, but are not restrained from using any care for their fatigue or a related symptoms/health complaints (e.g. through referral by their practitioner).

Ambulant people with chronic breathlessness due to the following conditions. Chronic breathlessness is defined as those with persistent disabling breathlessness despite optimum treatment (as described) of their underlying disease in the opinion of the identified clinician.<br>                1.1. Chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV) [HFPEF or HFNEF] with left ventricular dysfunction only and meets all of the following:<br>                1.1.1.

Reached target dose (or be on maximally tolerated dose, or be intolerant) of an aldosterone antagonist<br>                1.2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and receiving optimum treatment as follows (based on NICE idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/pirfenidone/nintedanib guidelines, British Thoracic Society ILD guidelines [includes CTD-associated ILD], American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guideline for IPF):<br>                1.2.1.

People with cancer, of any stage (0-4) may be included only if they are opioid naÃ¯ve (as defined in the exclusion criteria) as there are insufficient data to guide dosing of opioids for breathlessness in people already taking opioids for pain.<br>                2. Breathlessness severity defined as modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale grade 3 or 4 (i.e. stops for breath after walking about 100 yards or after a few minutes on level ground, or is too breathless to leave the house or is breathless when dressing). A pooled data study shows that people with worse baseline breathlessness are more likely to respond to opioids. A phase 3 trial in people with COPD showed that those with mMRC grade 3 or 4 were more likely to respond to opioids. This approach also concurs with clinical recommendations.<br>                3. Male or female aged =18 years<br>                4. Management of the underlying condition unchanged for the previous 7 days.

This, with criterion 4, is to identify patients most likely to complete the 2 months RCT phase.<br>                6. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of 25 ml/min or more, unless the primary diagnosis is heart failure (=30 ml/min). Renal clearance of eGFR =25 ml/min is adequate for the study doses of morphine, however, in heart failure patients are more likely to have fluctuations in renal function for which the higher level will allow.<br>	<br>                Randomised patients will receive either modified release morphine 5 mg capsules twice daily with docusate laxative 100 mg capsules twice daily (intervention arm 1) or placebo â€œ5mgâ€ morphine capsules twice daily and placebo docusate laxative capsules twice daily (intervention arm 2). To maintain blinding active drug and placebo capsules and their packaging will look the same.<br>                The dose may be increased to 10 mg twice daily if the participant does not achieve an improvement (reduction) from baseline in the primary outcome measures (worst breathlessness over the past 24 hours â€“ 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS)) and the participant had acceptable side-effects (see definition of acceptable side-effects below). The decision to dose escalate will be made if the NRS measure has not improved by at least one point at the day 7 assessment. The dose increase will start on day 15 to allow time for the prescription to be issued, dispensed and new dose to be supplied to the participant in a manner which ensures continuous drug supply. Whilst awaiting the new dose, the participant will continue on 5 mg twice daily.<br><br>                Dose titration applies only if the participant has acceptable side-effects<br><br>                The morphine preparation is MST Continus, encapsulated for blinding purposes.<br><br>                Each participant will take the study medication for two months.<br><br>                Acceptable side-effects in this trial are defined as:<br>                1.
